### Open all links in a new tab

  Without any success.

  At first, it should ask me Chrome version. I expect that according to some code and browser version, it can guide me better. 
  
  Not that at the end when there is not any solution, it said it can not be done in modern browser.

### Decrypt SSL request in Wireshark. 

At the end does not work.

Wrong way to set environment variable by `set SSLKEYLOGFILE=%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\sslkeys.log` but it sholud say to use `setx`



### Decompile an application

Decompile an application that refer me to repository those are not exist and suggest me to do some action manually, those are hard to do.

At the end i solved my problem by search. The key point was that use the fork ones that i got by search.



### SSL 1.3 and Win Server 2019

I got exception when i connect to a website that only support SSL 1.3. ChatGPT and Copilot both guided me to use `curl -v --tlsv1.2 ` that works and said me that if it works then there is some issue with your C# code. And it was wrong and guided me in a wrong way.

And also guided me to enable SSL 1.3 in Windows Server 2019 but the version i use does not support SSL 1.3 . But in another post, tell me correct answer but for Windows 10. 
But in future when i search for support TLS 1.3 in Win Server 2019, i understand that Win Server 2019 and Win 10 are based on the same OS or related to each other.

At the end i solve my issue by search.



### `MediaTek Wi-Fi 6 MT7921 Wireless LAN` issue . 

[Copilot did not help](../asus/MediaTek%20Wi-Fi%206%20MT7921%20issue/README.md#Copilot-did-not-help) and i solved by search.



## Help me but expect better help


### `UTF-8` support in `tree /F /A  > content.txt` command

It say, it does not support `UTF-8` but when i see command result in PowerShell it is OK, but when i use `tree > content.txt`, it does support `UTF-8`.
And then give a code that create something like `tree` command.

I myself solve my issue by right click on PowerShell header and use `Export text`.



### Why Fiddler does not show some desktop app request

I ask two times.

At first it guide me to use other apps such as Wireshark or ..., after some Q&A it give me a solution for `.Net app` to set manual proxy.

Second times Copilot give me an solution that only works for some situation (Flutter app) and does not work for some `.Net app`.

I expect that it gives me structured solution and why some solution works for some apps while does not works for others and vice versa.
