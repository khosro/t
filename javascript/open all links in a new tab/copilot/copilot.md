get js script that opne all link in a page in new tab

## **Copilot said**

Sure\! Here's a simple JavaScript script that opens all links on a page in new tabs:

javascript  
// Get all links on the page  
const links \= document.querySelectorAll('a');

// Iterate over each link  
links.forEach(link \=\> {  
  // Set the target attribute to "\_blank" to open the link in a new tab  
  link.setAttribute('target', '\_blank');  
});

You can run this script in the browser's console or include it in your webpage's JavaScript file. If you need any further assistance or have other questions, feel free to ask\!

## **You said**

no. it is only set target attribute. i want that all link in a page opens automatically

## **Copilot said**

Got it\! Here's a JavaScript script that will automatically open all the links on a page in new tabs:

javascript  
// Get all links on the page  
const links \= document.querySelectorAll('a');

// Iterate over each link and open it in a new tab  
links.forEach(link \=\> {  
  // Open each link in a new tab  
  window.open(link.href, '\_blank');  
});

You can run this script in the browser's console. Be cautious thoughâ€”opening many tabs at once could slow down your browser.

If you need any more tweaks or have other questions, feel free to ask\!

## **You said**

it is only open first one

## **Copilot said**

Understood. Here's an updated script that opens all links on the page in new tabs, with a slight delay between each link to ensure they all open:

javascript  
// Get all links on the page  
const links \= document.querySelectorAll('a');

// Function to open a link in a new tab  
const openLink \= (link, delay) \=\> {  
  setTimeout(() \=\> {  
    window.open(link.href, '\_blank');  
  }, delay);  
};

// Iterate over each link and open it in a new tab with a delay  
links.forEach((link, index) \=\> {  
  openLink(link, index \* 100); // Adjust the delay as needed (100ms here)  
});

This script adds a delay of 100 milliseconds between opening each link, ensuring that all links get opened in new tabs. Feel free to adjust the delay based on your needs. If you need any further assistance, just let me know\!

i tried it in chrome, but it is still ony open the first one in new tab\!\!\!

## **Copilot said**

It sounds like Chrome's built-in pop-up blocker might be limiting the script from opening multiple tabs. Here's another approach that uses an `iframe` to open all the links:

javascript  
// Get all links on the page  
const links \= document.querySelectorAll('a');

// Iterate over each link and open it in an iframe  
links.forEach((link, index) \=\> {  
  setTimeout(() \=\> {  
    const iframe \= document.createElement('iframe');  
    iframe.style.display \= 'none';  
    iframe.src \= link.href;  
    document.body.appendChild(iframe);  
  }, index \* 100); // Adjust the delay as needed (100ms here)  
});

This script creates an invisible `iframe` for each link and sets its source to the link's URL, effectively opening each link. Again, there's a delay of 100 milliseconds between each link to avoid overwhelming the browser.

Give this a try and see if it works better for you. If it still doesn't work, it might be a limitation of the browser's security policies. Let me know if you need any further assistance\!

## **You said**

it does not work any more . i go this error 'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 429 ()'

## **Copilot said**

The `429` status code indicates that too many requests have been made in a short period of time, and the server is limiting the number of requests.

As a workaround, you can try spacing out the requests even further to avoid hitting this rate limit. Here's an updated version of the script with a longer delay between each request:

javascript  
// Get all links on the page  
const links \= document.querySelectorAll('a');

// Iterate over each link and open it in an iframe with a longer delay  
links.forEach((link, index) \=\> {  
  setTimeout(() \=\> {  
    const iframe \= document.createElement('iframe');  
    iframe.style.display \= 'none';  
    iframe.src \= link.href;  
    document.body.appendChild(iframe);  
  }, index \* 1000); // Increase the delay to 1000ms (1 second) or more as needed  
});

This script increases the delay to 1000 milliseconds (1 second) between each request, but you can adjust this value based on the server's rate limit.

Keep in mind that some servers might have strict rate limits that make it challenging to open many links at once. If you still encounter issues, you might need to consider an alternative approach.

it does not work. i disapointed \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

## **Copilot said**

I'm really sorry that it's not working as expected. I understand how frustrating that can be.

Unfortunately, web browsers have strict security measures to prevent automated scripts from opening multiple tabs or making numerous requests in a short amount of time. These restrictions are in place to protect users from unwanted behavior.

One alternative approach is to use a browser extension or plugin designed to handle such tasks. For example, there are extensions available for Chrome that allow you to open multiple links at once. You can search for terms like "Open multiple links" in the Chrome Web Store to find such extensions.

Here are a few you might try:

1. **Linkclump** \- lets you open, copy or bookmark multiple links at once.  
2. **Multi Links Plus** \- allows you to open multiple links in new tabs with just a few clicks.

These extensions often provide more control and flexibility than a custom script, and they are specifically designed to work within the browser's security limitations.
